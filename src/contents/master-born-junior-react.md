Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the junior frontend developer position at Masterborn. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences, I believe I would be a valuable asset to your team.

I am currently studying at Wyższa Szkoła Bankowa in Gdańsk, where I have gained a solid foundation in computer science and web development. In my coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that have allowed me to hone my skills in these areas. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I believe that Masterborn's focus on innovation and growth provides the perfect environment for me to do so.

In addition to my studies, I have also gained practical experience in web development through my full-time position at Gr8Soft. Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, including the development of customer-facing websites and the implementation of responsive design. These experiences have allowed me to improve my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the web development process, including the use of React to build interactive and efficient user interfaces.

I am confident that my technical skills and passion for web development make me a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join the Masterborn team and contribute to the development of innovative and engaging web experiences.

Sincerely, <br>
Jakub Hajduk
