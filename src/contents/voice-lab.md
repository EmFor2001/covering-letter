description: Covering letter for VoiceLab Junior Frontend Developer
---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the junior frontend developer position at VoiceLab. As a current student with a passion for web development, I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team.

Throughout my studies and internships, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have a keen eye for design and a dedication to creating intuitive user experiences. In my previous internship at ABC Company, I worked on the development of a customer-facing e-commerce website, where I was responsible for implementing responsive design and optimizing the site for all devices. I also worked closely with the design team to implement the visual elements of the site, which allowed me to improve my skills in both design and development.

In addition to my studies, I am currently working full-time at Gr8Soft, where I have had the opportunity to gain practical experience in web development. I am confident that my technical skills and passion for web development make me a strong candidate for this position. I am excited about the opportunity to join VoiceLab and contribute to the development of innovative and engaging web experiences. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely, <br>
Jakub Hajduk
