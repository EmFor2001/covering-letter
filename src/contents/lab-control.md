Dear Hiring Manager,

As a junior frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I am excited to apply for the open position at LabControl. I am confident that my technical skills and passion for web development make me a strong fit for your team.

I am currently studying at Wyższa Szkoła Bankowa in Gdańsk, where I have gained a solid foundation in computer science and web development. In my coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that have allowed me to hone my skills in these areas. I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I believe LabControl's focus on innovation and collaboration provides the perfect environment for me to do so.

In addition to my studies, I am currently working full-time at Gr8Soft, where I have had the opportunity to gain practical experience in web development. I have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of customer-facing websites and the implementation of responsive design. These experiences have allowed me to improve my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the web development process.

I am excited about the opportunity to join LabControl and contribute to the development of innovative web experiences. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely, <br>
Jakub Hajduk
