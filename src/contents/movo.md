Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the junior frontend developer position at MOVO. As a current student with a passion for web development and more than a year of experience as a junior front-end developer at Gr8Soft, I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team.

Throughout my studies and work, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have a keen eye for design and a dedication to creating intuitive user experiences. At Gr8Soft, I have had the opportunity to gain practical experience in web development, working on a variety of projects including the development of customer-facing websites and the implementation of responsive design. These experiences have allowed me to improve my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the web development process.

I am confident that my technical skills and passion for web development make me a strong candidate for this position. I am excited about the opportunity to join MOVO and contribute to the development of innovative and engaging web experiences. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely, <br>
Jakub Hajduk
