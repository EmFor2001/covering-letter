Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the junior frontend developer position at Travactory. As a student with a passion for web development and over a year of practical experience as a junior front-end developer at Gr8Soft, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your team.

My studies and hands-on experience at Gr8Soft have equipped me with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am driven by a desire to create beautiful, user-friendly web experiences and am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and best practices. During my time at Gr8Soft, I have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of customer-facing websites and the implementation of responsive design. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills, but have also given me a deeper understanding of the web development process.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical abilities and passion for web development to Travactory. I am confident that I can contribute to the creation of innovative and engaging web experiences and am eager to learn from your talented team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely, <br>
